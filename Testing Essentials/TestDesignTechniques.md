# Test Design Techniques

we cannot perform each and every test that comes to our mind because of the time and the budget constraints 

so we use software testing techniques

# Equivalence Partitioning
based upon grouping the test cases and testing a single value from that group and then we assume the other test cases works too

# Boundary Value Analysis

in software majority of the bugs lies on the edges so we test the component with the values near the edges of the parition

# Decision Table Testing

used when the output depends upon a combination of different inputs so it lays down the required combinations easily

example login screen

# State Transition Testing

Testing the system as it moves from one state to other based on what user does

# Smoke Testing
Quick test to check the basic features of the application to ensure the application is working fine with the basic testing and we can proceed with other levels of testing

sanity test is targeting to check the working or validity of the new changed you have just introduced to your system like for a car - if a car starts is the smoke test and the testing the new system you just have installed is sanity testing


# RTM

it just makes sure every business requirement is tested or not 

for example
